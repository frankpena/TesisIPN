abstract = {Ultrasonic atomization has been attracting interest as a method of liquid atomization due to its advantage of electrical controllability. In the present work, an experimental study is performed to improve the understanding of the characteristics of ultrasonic atomization. A parametric analysis is performed to understand the effect of different operating parameters such as the flow rate of the carrier gas (air) and the height of the liquid column over the atomizer. The effect of liquid properties on the plume (jet) height and atomization rate is also studied. The unstable surface waves, which are responsible for the droplet formation, are visualized by backlight technique using a CCD camera with high magnification in order to get a good understanding of plume height, and the atomization rate is determined with varying carrier gas flow rate. The flow pattern (streak imaging) in the liquid is also being analyzed by introducing the particles in the medium. Results of the experiments indicate that the plume height for ethanol is the highest among the liquids studied and the minimum plume height is for urea water solution. The plume height is maximum for a liquid column height of 10 mm above the atomizer. The atomization rate for the liquids studied shows that atomization rate is maximum for column height of 20 mm and the maximum atomization rate is achieved where the plume height is lower.},

abstract = {Spatially localized, time-periodic structures are common in pattern-forming systems, appearing in fluid mechanics, chemical reactions, and granular media. We examine the existence of oscillatory localized states in a PDE model with single frequency time dependent forcing, introduced in [A. M. Rucklidge and M. Silber, SIAM J. Appl. Math., 8 (2009), pp. 298-347] as a phenomenological model of the Faraday wave experiment. In this study, we reduce the PDE model to the forced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation in the limit of weak forcing and weak damping. This allows us to use the known localized solutions found in [J. Burke, A. Yochelis, and E. Knobloch, SIAM J. Appl. Dyn. Syst., 7 (2008), pp. 651-711]. We reduce the forced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation to the Allen-Cahn equation near onset, obtaining an asymptotically exact expression for localized solutions. We also extend this analysis to the strong forcing case, recovering the Allen-Cahn equation directly without the intermediate step. We find excellent agreement between numerical localized solutions of the PDE, localized solutions of the forced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and analytic (hyperbolic) solutions of the Allen-Cahn equation. This is the first time that a PDE with time dependent forcing has been reduced to the Allen-Cahn equation and its localized oscillatory solutions quantitatively studied. {\textcopyright} 2014 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {The Faraday instability appears on liquid baths submitted to vertical oscillations above a critical value. The pattern of standing ripples at half the vibrating frequency that results from this parametric forcing is usually shaped by the boundary conditions imposed by the enclosing receptacle. Here, we show that the time modulation of the medium involved in the Faraday instability can act as a phase-conjugate mirror––a fact which is hidden in the extensively studied case of the boundary-driven regime. We first demonstrate the complete analogy with the equations governing its optical counterpart. We then use water baths combining shallow and deep areas of arbitrary shapes to spatially localize the Faraday instability. We give experimental evidence of the ability of the Faraday instability to generate counterpropagating phase-conjugated waves for any propagating signal wave. The canonical geometries of a point and plane source are implemented. We also verify that Faraday-based phase-conjugate mirrors hold the genuine property of being shape independent. These results show that a periodic modulation of the effective gravity can perform time-reversal operations on monochromatic propagating water waves, with a remarkable efficiency compared with wave manipulation in other fields of physics.},

abstract = {In this work we investigate, by way of experiments and theory, the Faraday instability threshold in cylinders at low frequencies. This implies large wavelengths where effects from mode discretization cannot be ignored. Careful selection of the working fluids has resulted in an immiscible interface whose apparent contact line with the sidewall can glide over a tiny film of the more wetting fluid, without detachment of its actual contact line. This unique behaviour has allowed for a system whose primary dissipation is defined by the bulk viscous effects, and in doing so, for the first time, close connection is seen with the viscous linear stability theory for which a stress-free condition is assumed at the sidewalls. As predicted, mode selection and co-dimension 2 points are observed in the experiment for a frequency range including subharmonic, harmonic, and superharmonic modes. While agreement with the predictions are generally excellent, there are deviations from the theory for certain modes and these are explained in the context of harmonic meniscus waves. A review of previous work on single-mode excitation in cylinders is given, along with comparison to the viscous model and analysis based upon the conclusions of the current experiments.},

Under the proper conditions, the thresholds and onset wavelengths agree with recent theoretical predictions for a laterally infinite, finite-depth container filled with a viscous fluid. Experimentally, we show that by using a viscous, non-polar fluid, the finite-size effects of sidewalls and the effects of surface contamination can be made negligible. We also show that finite-size corrections are of order h/L, where h is the fluid depth and L the container size. Based on these measurements, one can more easily interpret certain unexpected observations from previous experimental studies of the Faraday instability.},

abstract = {A vessel containing a heavy liquid vibrates vertically with constant frequency and amplitude. It has been observed that for some combinations of frequency and amplitude standing waves are formed at the free surface of the liquid, while for other combinations the free surface remains plane. In this paper the stability of the plane free surface is investigated theoretically when the vessel is a vertical cylinder with a horizontal base, and the liquid is an ideal frictionless fluid making a constant angle of contact of 90 degrees with the walls of the vessel. When the cross-section of the cylinder and the frequency and amplitude of vibration of the vessel are prescribed, the theory predicts that the mth mode will be excited when the corresponding pair of parameters (p[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}, q[IMG]f1.gif" ALT="Formula" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}) lies in an unstable region of the stability chart; the surface is stable if none of the modes is excited. (The corresponding frequencies are also shown on the chart.) The theory explains the disagreement between the experiments of Faraday and Rayleigh on the one hand, and of Matthiessen on the other. An experiment was made to check the application of the theory to a real fluid (water). The agreement was satisfactory; the small discrepancy is ascribed to wetting effects for which no theoretical estimate could be given.},

abstract = {The atomization of liquids into a spray is an important process in many industrial applications and particularly in the aero-engine sector. Conventional air-blast injectors in aircraft engines today use aerodynamic shearing effects to atomize the liquid fuel. However, at operating conditions where the air velocity is below 30 m/s (such as ground start and high altitude restart) the atomization quality is poor. Consequently combustion is less efficient with high pollutant emissions. The objective of this study is to validate a new concept of injector which couples the shearing effects with the principle of ultrasonic atomization. The latter consists of using piezoelectric actuators to generate the oscillations of a wall in contact with the liquid film. This excitation perpendicular to the liquid film surface creates Faraday instabilities at the liquid/air interface. Amplitudes higher than a defined threshold value induce the break-up of ligaments and the formation of droplets. To cite this article: M. Boukra et al., C. R.

abstract = {Faraday Waves is a short audio-visual work written as a companion piece for a concert-hall performance of Po�me �lectronique by Varese. Faraday discovered that a liquid undergoing vertical vibration, whose frequency exceeds a certain value, becomes unstable to surface waves. Also known as Faraday Instability, they form non-linear standing waves that appear on liquids enclosed by a vibrating vessel. In ordinary Newtonian fluids (those that do not exhibit shear thickening or shear thinning) the wave patterns include ones with 1-fold symmetry (stripes), 2-fold symmetry (squares), 3-fold symmetry (hexagons) as well as higher orders of symmetry. The effect was first reported by Michael Faraday in 1831, and forms one of many experiments in visualizing vibration and sound ? a means of converting analogue data from one form to another.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Thanks to an award from Santander, the composer was able to visit his colleague Professor Stephen Morris at the Physics Department, University of Toronto in May 2015.

abstract = {In this paper, we present an optical profilometric technique that allows for single-shot global measurement of free-surface deformations. This system consists of a high-resolution system composed of a videoprojector and a digital camera. A fringe pattern of known characteristics is projected onto the free surface and its image is registered by the camera. The deformed fringe pattern arising from the surface deformations is later compared to the undeformed (reference) one, leading to a phase map from which the free surface can be reconstructed. Particularly, we are able to project wavelength-controlled sinusoidal fringe patterns, which considerably increase the overall performance of the technique and the quality of the reconstruction compared to that obtained with a Ronchi grating. In comparison to other profilometric techniques, it allows for single-shot non-intrusive measurement of surface deformations over large areas. In particular, our measurement system and analysis technique is able to measure free surface deformations with sharp slopes up to 10 with a 0.2 mm vertical resolution over an interrogation window of size 450 × 300 mm2 sampled on approximately 6.1 × 106 measurement points. Some illustrative examples of the application of this measuring system to fluid dynamics problems are presented. {\textcopyright} 2009 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Experiments are described on surface gravity-capillary waves in a 70 cm × 2.8 cm rectangular tank undergoing small vertical oscillations. The large aspect ratio of the tank permits study of several neighbouring two-dimensional wave modes; their onset, hysteresis and instability. Two water depths, close to one and two centimetres, are investigated in detail. Thresholds are determined for wave onset from a flat surface and the hysteretic return to a flat surface from finite-amplitude waves. Also, conditions at which a pure standing wave becomes unstable to other modes are established. Our finding of hysteresis below the minimum forcing for linear wave-onset suggests that nonlinear forcing and nonlinear damping are both significant, as recently suggested by Miles (J. Fluid Mechanics 248 (1993) 671.) A theoretical model, incorporating these effects, is analysed and the corresponding hysteresis boundaries established. These are broadly consistent with our experimental results. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Motivations varied from turbulence observed in real flows to permanence expected in hydrodynamic theories of matter. Contemporary mathematics often failed to provide rigorous answers, and personal intuitions sometimes gave wrong results. Yet some of the basic ideas and methods of the modern theory of hydrodynamic instability occurred to the elite of British and German mathematical physics, including Stokes, Kelvin, Helmholtz, and Rayleigh. This usually happened by reflecting on concrete specific problems, with a striking variety of investigative styles.},

Results indicate that the optimal cluster size for maximizing fusion events should be in the 0.01–1 $\mu$m diameter range, but an appropriate source of droplets of this size does not exist. In an attempt to meet this need, we use ultrasonic atomization to generate micron-scale droplet aerosols of high average density, and we have developed and refined a reliable droplet sizing technique based on Mie scattering. Harmonic excitation of the fluid in the MHz range yields an aerosol of droplets with diameters of a few microns. The droplet diameter distribution is well-peaked and the relationship between average droplet size and forcing frequency follows an inviscid scaling law, predictable by dimensional analysis and consistent with the linear theory for Faraday excitation of an infinitely deep fluid.{\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Eddi2011,
abstract = {On a vertically vibrating fluid interface, a droplet can remain bouncing indefinitely. When approaching the Faraday instability onset, the droplet couples to the wave it generates and starts propagating horizontally. The resulting wave–particle association, called a walker, was shown previously to have remarkable dynamical properties, reminiscent of quantum behaviours. In the present article, the nature of a walker's wave field is investigated experimentally, numerically and theoretically. It is shown to result from the superposition of waves emitted by the droplet collisions with the interface. A single impact is studied experimentally and in a fluidmechanics theoretical approach. It is shown that each shock emits a radial travelling wave, leaving behind a localized mode of slowly decaying Faraday standing waves. As it moves, the walker keeps generating waves and the global structure of the wave field results from the linear superposition of the waves generated along the recent trajectory. For rectilinear trajectories, this results in a Fresnel interference pattern of the global wave field. Since the droplet moves due to its interaction with the distorted interface, this means that it is guided by a pilot wave that contains a path memory. Through this wave-mediated memory, the past as well as the environment determines the walker's present motion.},

abstract = {Parametric excitation of surface waves via forced vertical oscillation of a container filled with fluid (the Faraday instability) is investigated experimentally in a small-depth large-aspect-ratio system, with a viscous fluid and with two simultaneous forcing frequencies. The asymptotic pattern observed just above the threshold for the first instability of the flat surface is found to depend strongly on the frequency ratio and the amplitudes and phases of the two sinusoidal components of the driving acceleration. Parallel lines, squares, and hexagons are observed. With viscosity 100 cS, these stable standing-wave patterns do not exhibit strong sidewall effects, and are found in containers of various shapes including an irregular shape. A ‘quasi-pattern' of twelvefold symmetry, analogous to a two-dimensional quasi-crystal, is observed for some even/odd frequency ratios. Many of the experimental phenomena can be modelled via cubic-order amplitude equations derived from symmetry arguments.},

You are all, no doubt, quite familiar with the concepts of electric and magnetic fields, but I wonder how many of you can answer the following question. “Do electric and magnetic fields have a real physical existence or are they just the- oretical constructs which we use to calculate the electric and magnetic forces exerted by charged particles on one another?” In trying to formulate an answer to this question we shall, hopefully, come to a better understanding of the nature of electric and magnetic fields and the reasons why it is necessary to use these concepts in order to fully describe electric and magnetic phenomena.},

abstract = {Computing comprises three distinct strands: hardware, software and the ways they are used in real or imagined worlds. Its use in research is more than writing or running code. Having something significant to compute and deploying judgement in what is attempted and achieved are especially challenging. In science or engineering, one must define a central problem in computable form, run such software as is appropriate and, last but by no means least, convince others that the results are both valid and useful. These several strands are highly interdependent. A major scientific development can transform disparate aspects of information and computer technologies. Computers affect the way we do science, as well as changing our personal worlds. Access to information is being transformed, with consequences beyond research or even science. Creativity in research is usually considered uniquely human, with inspiration a central factor. Scientific and technological needs are major forces in innovation, and these include hardware and software opportunities. One can try to define the scientific needs for established technologies (atomic energy, the early semiconductor industry), for rapidly developing technologies (advanced materials, microelectronics) and for emerging technologies (nanotechnology, novel information technologies). Did these needs define new computing, or was science diverted into applications of then-available codes? Regarding credibility, why is it that engineers accept computer realizations when designing engineered structures, whereas predictive modelling of materials has yet to achieve industrial confidence outside very special cases? The tensions between computing and traditional science are complex, unpredictable and potentially powerful.},

abstract = {We study the generation of 2D turbulence in Faraday waves by investigating the creation of spatially periodic vortices in this system. Measurements which couple a diffusing light imaging technique and particle tracking algorithms allow the simultaneous observation of the three-dimensional fluid motion and of the temporal changes in the wave field topography. Quasi-standing waves are found to coexist with a spatially extended fluid transport. More specifically, the destruction of regular patterns of oscillons coincides with the emergence of a complex fluid motion whose statistics are similar to that of two-dimensional turbulence. We reveal that a lattice of oscillons generates vorticity at the oscillon scale in the horizontal flow. The interaction of these vortices explain how 2D turbulence is fueled by almost standing waves. Remarkably, the curvature of Lagrangian trajectories reveals a "footprint" of the forcing scale vortices in fully developed turbulence. 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence should be considered a source of disorder in Faraday waves. These findings also provide a new paradigm for vorticity creation in 2D flows.},

abstract = {When contacting with acoustically-vibrated structures a fluid volume can take a [time-averaged] geometric shape differing from capillary equilibrium. In accordance with theorems by Beyer et al. (2001) this shape (vibroequilibrium) furnishes a local minimum of a [quasi-potential energy] functional. The variational problem contains five dimensionless parameters evaluating the fluid volume, the wave number of acoustic field in the fluid domain, the contact angle and two newly-introduced numbers (eta(1),eta(2)) giving relationships between (surface tension, gravitation) and Kapitsa's vibrational forces/energy. The paper focuses on negligible small wave numbers (incompressible fluid) and two-dimensional flows. Although the variational problem may in some isolated cases have analytical solutions, it requires in general numerical approaches. Numerical examples simulate experiments by Wolf (1969) and Ganiyev et al. (1977) on vibroequilibria in horizontally vibrating tanks. These show that there appear at least two types of stable vibroequilibria associated with symmetric (possible non-connected) and asymmetric surface shapes. The paper represents also numerical results on flattening and vibrostabilisation of a drop hanging beneath a vibrating plate (experiments by Faraday (1831)).},

abstract = {We present statistical measurements of spatially and temporally chaotic surface waves in relatively large containers (10-30 wavelengths across) with various boundary geometries and wetting conditions. The patterns are measured using transmission optics and video image processing. Although the instantaneous patterns are highly disordered, they retain sufficient phase coherence that the time-averaged images have spatially periodic structure. The symmetry of the time-averaged images is related to the symmetry of the boundaries. The convergence of the averaging process is significantly slower than that of a Gaussian random process. An average image can be explained as arising from amplitude and phase fluctuations about a base wave pattern. The form of the base pattern is that expected near onset in an infinite system. The amplitude of the average image, which decreases with drive amplitude, is related to the variance of phase fluctuations. Despite the relatively large dimensions, the base pattern is box quantized by the cell walls. Nonhysteretic jumps occur between these states as the drive frequency is varied. Close to the jumps the patterns fluctuate between several quantized states. Some of the statistical methods utilized here could be employed to analyze spatiotemporal chaos in other systems. {\textcopyright} 1995 The American Physical Society.},

We define new scale and shape descriptors, which helps to considerably reduce the size of equivalence classes of lattice bases. These finitely many equivalence relations are fully characterized by modular group theory. We construct the lattice space {\$}\backslashmathscr{\{}L{\}}{\$} based on the equivalent descriptors and define a metric {\$}d{\_}{\{}\backslashmathscr{\{}L{\}}{\}}{\$} to accurately quantify the visual similarities and differences between lattices. Furthermore, we introduce the Lattice Identification and Separation Algorithm (LISA), which identifies each lattice patterns from superposed lattices. LISA finds lattice candidates from the high responses in the image spectrum, then sequentially extracts different layers of lattice patterns one by one. Analyzing the frequency components, we reveal the intricate dependency of LISA's performances on particle radius, lattice density, and relative translations. Various numerical experiments are designed to show LISA's robustness against a large number of lattice layers, moir$\backslash$'{\{}e{\}} patterns and missing particles.},

abstract = {A popular method for generating micron-sized aerosols is to submerge ultrasonic ($\omega${\~{}}MHz) piezoelectric oscillators in a water bath. The submerged oscillator atomizes the fluid, creating droplets with radii proportional to the wavelength of the standing wave at the fluid surface. Classical theory for the Faraday instability predicts a parametric instability driving a capillary wave at the subharmonic ($\omega$/2) frequency. For many applications it is desirable to reduce the size of the droplets; however, using higher frequency oscillators becomes impractical beyond a few MHz. Observations are presented that demonstrate that smaller droplets may also be created by increasing the driving amplitude of the oscillator, and that this effect becomes more pronounced for large driving frequencies. It is shown that these observations are consistent with a transition from droplets associated with subharmonic ($\omega$/2) capillary waves to harmonic ($\omega$) capillary waves induced by larger driving frequencies and amplitudes, as predicted by a stability analysis of the capillary waves.},

abstract = {The Faraday resonance of interfacial waves in a two-layer, weakly-viscous system in a rectangular domain is presented. A perturbation analysis is pursued and, at the second-order, the scaling of the viscosity results in boundary layer corrections at the solid walls and at the interface. Special attention is paid to the damping in the meniscus region where the interface contacts the side-walls. As a result of the presence of both destabilizing effects (vertical oscillation) and stabilizing effects (viscosity), a threshold condition for instability is determined. The derived analytic results are quite general and prove useful in elucidating the influences of the various boundary layers, as well as the threshold for growth. In an effort to describe the maximum amplitude attained by the resonated wave, a third-order analysis is then presented for the idealized case of equal-depth, inviscid layers, with a rigid-lid condition at the free surface. A balance between cubic nonlinearity and the vertical shaking yields a Landau-type equation for the interfacial wave amplitude. Comparisons with some existing experimental data are made at both orders and indicate very good agreement. {\textcopyright} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Fuel atomization will seriously affect the combustion and emission characteristics of IC engine. It is important to study the atomization characteristics of single droplet under dynamic inertial force for improving the high precision secondary atomization model in cylinder. Firstly, the process of droplet atomization under sinusoidal inertial force was studied experimentally. Then, the effects of dimensionless parameters, including Bond number (Bo), gas-liquid density ratio ($\rho$G/L), gas-liquid viscous ratio ($\mu$G/L), Weber number (We)and Reynolds number (Re), on the average wavelength and atomization time of droplet surface wave were numerically investigated. The results show that with the development of time, the droplet surface appears zonal standing wave, radial standing wave and volcanic standing wave in turn. When the droplet atomizes, the sub droplet sprays first from the top of the droplet, and the atomization intensity at the top is stronger than that at both sides. Bo, $\rho$G/L and Re have little influence on the average wavelength of droplet surface wave, $\mu$G/L has no effect, while We has a great influence. As Bo, We and Re increase, the atomization time decreases rapidly at first, and then converges. When We {\textgreater} 104 or Re {\textgreater} 104, the effect of surface tension and viscous force on atomization time can be neglected. As $\rho$G/L increases, the atomization time first remains unchanged and then increases rapidly. When $\rho$G/L {\textless} 0.1, its influence can be neglected. $\mu$G/L has no effect on the atomization time. Furthermore, according to the variation of the average wavelength and We number, the dimensionless form of the empirical formula for the average diameter of droplets is obtained: dm∗=(1.0±0.1)∙We-1/3. Finally, the critical conditions of droplet atomization are determined based on the actual atomization time of IC engine.},

abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the linear surface wave instabilities of a shallow viscous fluid layer and the shape of the periodic, parametric-forcing function (describing the vertical acceleration of the fluid container) that excites them. We find numerically that the envelope of the resonance tongues can only develop multiple minima when the forcing function has more than two local extrema per cycle. With this insight, we construct a multi-frequency forcing function that generates at onset a non-trivial harmonic instability which is distinct from a subharmonic response to any of its frequency components. We measure the corresponding surface patterns experimentally and verify that small changes in the forcing waveform cause a transition, through a bicritical point, from the predicted harmonic short-wavelength pattern to a much larger standard subharmonic pattern. Using a formulation valid in the lubrication regime (thin viscous fluid layer) and a WKB method to find its analytic solutions, we explore the origin of the observed relation between the forcing function shape and the resonance tongue structure. In particular, we show that for square and triangular forcing functions the envelope of these tongues has only one minimum, as in the usual sinusoidal case.},

abstract = {We present measurements of the complete spatio-temporal Fourier spectrum of Faraday waves. The Faraday waves are generated at the interface of two immiscible index matched liquids of different density. By use of a new absorption technique we are able to determine the bifurcation scenario from the flat surface to the patterned state for each complex spatial and temporal Fourier component separately. The measured surface spectra at onset are in good agreement with the predictions from a linear stability analysis. For the nonlinear state our measurements show in a direct manner how energy is transferred from lower to higher harmonics and we quantify the nonlinear coupling coefficients. Furthermore we find that the nonlinear coupling generates constant components in the spatial Fourier spectrum leading to a contribution of a non oscillating permanent sinusoidal deformed surface state. A comparison of a hexagonal and a rectangular pattern reveals that spatial resonances only can give rise to a spectrum that violates the temporal resonance conditions given by the weakly nonlinear theory.},

abstract = {Surface wave patterns are investigated experimentally in a system geometry that has become a paradigm of quantum chaos: the stadium billiard. Linear waves in bounded geometries for which classical ray trajectories are chaotic are known to give rise to scarred patterns. Here, we utilize parametrically forced surface waves (Faraday waves), which become progressively nonlinear beyond the wave instability threshold, to investigate the subtle interplay between boundaries and nonlinearity. Only a subset (three main types) of the computed linear modes of the stadium are observed in a systematic scan. These correspond to modes in which the wave amplitudes are strongly enhanced along paths corresponding to certain periodic ray orbits. Many other modes are found to be suppressed, in general agreement with a prediction by Agam and Altshuler based on boundary dissipation and the Lyapunov exponent of the associated orbit. Spatially asymmetric or disordered (but time-independent) patterns are also found even near onset. As the driving acceleration is increased, the time-independent scarred patterns persist, but in some cases transitions between modes are noted. The onset of spatiotemporal chaos at higher forcing amplitude often involves a nonperiodic oscillation between spatially ordered and disordered states. We characterize this phenomenon using the concept of pattern entropy. The rate of change of the patterns is found to be reduced as the state passes temporarily near the ordered configurations of lower entropy. We also report complex but highly symmetric (time-independent) patterns far above onset in the regime that is normally chaotic.},

abstract = {We report novel superlattice wave patterns at the interface of a fluid layer driven vertically. These patterns are described most naturally in terms of two interacting hexagonal sublattices. Two frequency forcing at very large aspect ratio is utilized in this work. A superlattice pattern (“superlattice-I”) consisting of two hexagonal lattices oriented at a relative angle of 22° is obtained with a 6:7 ratio of forcing frequencies. Several theoretical approaches that may be useful in understanding this pattern have been proposed. In another example, the waves are fully described by two superimposed hexagonal lattices with a wavelength ratio of Image , oriented at a relative angle 30°. The time dependence of this “suoerlattice-II” wave pattern is unusual. The instantaneous patterns reveal a time-periodic stripe modulation that breaks the sixfold symmetry at any instant, but the stripes are absent in the time average. The instantaneous patterns are not simply amplitude modulations of the primary standing wave. A transition from the superlattice-II state to a 12-fold quasi-crystalline pattern is observed by changing the relative phase of the two forcing frequencies. Phase diagrams of the observed patterns (including superlattices, quasicrystalline patterns, ordinary hexagons, and squares) are obtained as a function of the amplitudes and relative phases of the driving accelerations.},

This makes harmonic solutions possible at the onset in a laterally large container, which is qualitatively different from the results of nearly inviscid theory.

The hydrodynamic system in the presence of viscosity cannot be reduced to a system of Mathieu equations with linear damping. For a given driving frequency, the instability occurs only for certain combinations of the wavelength and driving amplitude, leading to tongue-like stability zones. The viscosity has a qualitative effect on the wavelength at onset: at small viscosities, the wavelcngth decreases with increasing viscosity, while it increases for higher viscosities. The stability threshold is in good agreement with experimental results. Based on the analysis, a method for the measurement of the interfacial tension, and the sum of densities and dynamic viscosities of two phases of a fluid near the liquid-vapour critical point is proposed.},

The focus is on the case where the viscous effects are strong, i.e., when the wavelength is of the same order of magnitude as the boundary layer thickness at the free surface. We investigate the relationship between the Faraday instability and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability by performing linear stability calculations. In the deep water limit (wavelength {\textless} liquid depth), our results indicate that the preferred wave number in the Faraday instability is primarily determined through a Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In the case of shallow water (wavelength approximately liquid depth), the agreement between the Rayleigh-Taylor and Faraday wave numbers does not appear to be as good, probably due to the interaction between the oscillatory motion of the standing waves and the bottom boundary.},

A 8, S330-S336, 2006) presented a MEMS-based tunable liquid micro-lens system with an aperture of 300 micrometers. The system exhibited a tuning range of back focal length between 2.3mm and infinity by using the electrowetting effect to change the contact angle of the meniscus shape on silicon with a voltage of 0-45 V. However, spherical aberration was found in their lens system. In the present study, a numerical simulation is performed for this same physical configuration by solving the Young-Laplace equation on the interface of the lens liquid and the surrounding liquid. The resulting meniscus shape produces a back focal length that agrees with the experimental observation excellently. To eliminate the spherical aberration, an electric field is applied on the lens. The electric field alters the Young-Laplace equation and thus changes the meniscus shape and the lens quality. The numerical result shows that the spherical aberration of the lens can be essentially eliminated when a proper electric field is applied.},

abstract = {The instability of Faraday waves in Hele-Shaw cells is investigated experimentally and theoretically. A novel hydrodynamic model involving capillary action is proposed to capture the variation of the dynamic contact line between two close walls of narrow containers. The amplitude equations are derived from the gap-averaged model. By means of Lyapunov's first method, a good prediction of the onset threshold of forcing acceleration is obtained, which shows the model's validity for addressing the stability problem for Faraday waves in Hele-Shaw cells. It is found that the effect of the dynamic contact line is much greater than that of Poiseuille assumption of velocity profile for the cases under investigation. A new dispersion relation is obtained, which agrees well with experimental data. However, we highly recommend the conventional dispersion relation for gravity–capillary waves, which can generally meet common needs. Surface tension is found to be a key factor of interface flows in Hele-Shaw cells. According to our experimental observations, a liquid film is found on the front wall of the Hele-Shaw cell when the wave is falling. As a property of the friction coefficient from molecular kinetics, wet and dry plates show different wetting procedures. Unlike some authors of previous publications, we attribute the hysteresis to the out-of-plane interface shape rather than to detuning, i.e. the difference between natural frequency and response frequency.},

abstract = {Ligament formation from the surface of a horizontal liquid layer subject to a vertical vibration (Faraday instability) is a crucial part of the atomization process because it is the transition phase for droplet generation. Based on the numerical solutions of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations for a prototype Faraday instability flow, we explored physically how a liquid ligament that is dynamically free from the vibrating liquid layer and behaves like a jet can be produced. According to linear theory, the suction of liquid from the trough portion to the crest portion creates an amplified crest. The amplified crest is always pulled back to the liquid layer in linear theory, no matter how largely the surface deforms; thus, a dynamically freed ligament never forms. However, under nonlinear conditions produced by large surface deformation, the impinging liquid flow from the trough portion enhances the pressure at the high crest (ligament) root. This pressure enhancement has two major effects. First, it reduces the amount of liquid sucked from the trough portion, which abates the increase in the crest height compared with that associated with linear theory. Second, it forms a local maximum pressure at the crest root; in this case, the ligament above this location becomes dynamically free from the motion of the bottom substrate in the laboratory reference frame. Liquid elements continuously enter the dynamically freed liquid region, producing a slender ligament from the liquid layer. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = { A vertically vibrating liquid layer produces liquid ligaments that disintegrate to form a spray with drops of a controllable size. Previous experimental investigations of ultrasonic atomisation have shown that when such a spray forms, there exists a predominant surface-wave mode from which drops are generated with a mean diameter that follows Lang's equation. In this paper, we determined this predominant surface-wave mode physically and, by utilising the coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid method, we numerically studied the threshold condition for spray formation based on a cell model of the predominant surface wavelength that excludes the effects of the container walls. We defined a condition whereby the broken drop holds a zero area-averaged vertical velocity in the laboratory reference frame as the criterion for the formation of a spray. The results of our calculations indicated that the onset of a spray occurs in the subharmonic unstable region for a threshold dimensionless forcing strength    {\$}{\{}\backslashit\backslashbeta{\}}{\_}{\{}c{\}}=({\{}\backslashit\backslashrho{\}}{\_}{\{}l{\}}{\{}\backslashit\backslashDelta{\}}{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}{\{}\backslashit\backslashOmega{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}})/{\{}\backslashit\backslashsigma{\}}\backslashsim O(1){\$}   , where    {\$}{\{}\backslashit\backslashrho{\}}{\_}{\{}l{\}}{\$}   and    {\$}{\{}\backslashit\backslashsigma{\}}{\$}   denote the liquid density and surface tension coefficient, respectively,    {\$}{\{}\backslashit\backslashDelta{\}}{\_}{\{}0{\}}{\$}   is the forcing displacement amplitude and    {\$}{\{}\backslashit\backslashOmega{\}}{\$}   is the forcing angular frequency. Spray formation due to the Faraday instability can be considered as a process whereby the liquid layer absorbs energy from the inertial force, and releases it by producing drops that leave the surface of the liquid layer. We demonstrated that for a deep liquid layer, the threshold condition for the formation of a spray is determined only by the forcing strength, and is independent of the initial conditions of the liquid surface. },

abstract = {Simulations of the Faraday instability in a rectangular-shaped vessel with well, filled with a viscous fluid, are presented. Oscillations promoted by applying a vertical vibration of a given frequency and amplitude show the following features: (i) unstable waves become increasingly localized in the well as the amplitude of vibration increases, (ii) the threshold amplitude for an arbitrary well width is bounded by the thresholds of a vessel with no well and liquid layers thicknesses equal to those in either the plateau or in the well region, and (iii) below threshold, a weak horizontal component triggers harmonic oscillations. Experiments carried out in a vessel filled with ethanol allowed to observe wave localization and, below threshold, the harmonic wave. Below threshold, the harmonic wave had been previously observed as the only possible wave in a square vessel with an immersed concentric square well. Novel theoretical tools are developed to investigate this system: A generalized Mathieu equation is used to handle the case without well, whereas a numerical transfer matrix method is applied to the case with well. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

The first part covers the basic theory of electrostatics, electromagnetism and electroconductive fields and applies the theory to different transmission lines. It culminates in a comparison of the basic relationships that lie behind all the field systems covered. The second part covers the physical effects of dielectrics and ferrous materials on capacitors and coils. It is truly introductory with very little prior knowledge assumed. The mathematical techniques required to manipulate the theory are introduced from basics and there are numerous worked examples and problems. Self-assessment questions are given at the end of each chapter to allow the student to check their understanding of material before moving onto further chapters. This is an accessible and self-contained introduction to a topic that all physical scientists and engineers must get to grips with before developing their knowledge further.},

abstract = {The impact of a distilled water droplet upon a heated wax surface was investigated experimentally using a high-speed digital camera. The droplet impact Weber number (We) was varied and the collision dynamics were investigated with the temperature of the wax surface varied from 20 to 75 ??C. For each impact We number, the evolution of the liquid film diameter was measured as a function of surface temperature. At We=27, the liquid film diameter was observed to recoil faster as the surface temperature of the wax was increased. At We=150, as the droplet recoiled, an unstable column of fluid was observed to rise above the wax surface. The instability of the fluid column at We=150 was explained using Rayleigh instability theory. At the melting point of the wax, 75 ??C, the droplet impacted upon a liquid surface. Over the range of impact We numbers considered, the jet formed in the molten wax pool did not result in separation of droplets from the jet. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We consider the weakly nonlinear evolution of the Faraday waves produced in a vertically vibrated two-dimensional liquid layer, at small viscosity. It is seen that the surface wave evolves to a drifting standing wave, namely a wave that is standing in a moving reference frame. This wave is determined up to a spatial phase, whose calcu-lation requires consideration of the associated mean flow. This is just the streaming flow generated in the boundary layer attached to the lower p{\'{i}}ate supporting the liquid. A system of equations is derived for the coupled slow evolution of the spatial phase and the streaming flow. These equations are numerically integrated to show that the simplest reflection symmetric steady state (the usual array of counter-rotating eddies below the surface wave) becomes unstable for realistic val{\'{u}}es of the parameters. The new states include limit cycles (the array of eddies oscillating laterally), drifted stand-ing waves (patterns that are standing in a uniformly propagating reference frame) and some more complex attractors.},

abstract = {Rayleigh (1883) observed that the frequency of parametrically excited capillary-gravity waves in a container of lateral dimensions large compared with the wavelength was only 75{\%} of the frequency omega0 calculated from Kelvin's dispersion relation for waves of the observed length, and attributed this discrepancy to friction. A boundary-layer calculation on the assumption that the free surface acts as an inextensible film (as is typical for water in the laboratory) yields a 10{\%} reduction from omega0. The remaining discrepancy may be plausibly attributed to a contamination-induced reduction of surface tension from the value assumed by Rayleigh, but the possibility remains that nonlinearity could account for a significant shift of the frequency from omega0. The solution of the weakly nonlinear problem for parametrically excited capillary-gravity waves reveals that this shift is positive for Rayleigh's data, whence the surface tension must have been even smaller than that inferred from Kelvin's dispersion relation. This solution also suggests quantitative errors in the solutions of Ezerskii et al. (1986) and Milner (1991) for the limiting case of deep-water capillary waves.},

(1986) and Milner (1991) in the limit of deep-water capillary waves (k d , k l , {\%} 1, where 1, is the capillary length). Ezerskii et al. show that the square pattern is unstable for sufficiently large E -6, and Milner shows that nonlinear damping is necessary for equilibration of the square pattern. The present formulation extends those of Ezerskii et al. and Milner to capillary-gravit,y waves and finite depth and incorporates third-order parametric forcing, which is neglected in these earlier formulations but is comparable with third-order damp-ing. There are quantitative differences in the resulting evolution equations (for kd, kl, {\textgreater}{\textgreater} l), which appear to reflect errors in the earlier work. These formulations determine a locus of admissible waves, but they do not select a particular wave. The hypothesis that the selection process maximizes the energy-transfer rate to the Faraday wave selects the maximum of the resonance curve in a frequency-amplitude plane.},

This functional determines the wavenumber and symmetry (square) of the most stable uniform state.

A column of liquid is placed between a nozzle outlet and a moving wall, and calculations are done in two dimensions with a fixed distance between the nozzle and the wall. The results show that the wall velocity creates a circulation near the meniscus base, resulting in transient heat conduction. The local wall heat transfer is found to vary significantly along the meniscus base, the highest being near the advancing contact line. The heat transfer coefficient is found to depend on the advancing contact angle and wall velocity but is independent of the wall superheat. Reasonable agreement is observed when the meniscus profile and heat transfer results obtained from the nu-merical simulation are compared to the experimental data.},

abstract = {A theoretical framework to study linear and nonlinear Richtmyer-Meshkov instability (RMI) is presented. This instability typically develops when an incident shock crosses a corrugated material interface separating two fluids with different thermodynamic properties. Because the contact surface is rippled, the transmitted and reflected wavefronts are also corrugated, and some circulation is generated at the material boundary. The velocity circulation is progressively modified by the sound wave field radiated by the wavefronts, and ripple growth at the contact surface reaches a constant asymptotic normal velocity when the shocks/rarefactions are distant enough. The instability growth is driven by two effects: an initial deposition of velocity circulation at the material interface by the corrugated shock fronts and its subsequent variation in time due to the sonic field of pressure perturbations radiated by the deformed shocks. First, an exact analytical model to determine the asymptotic linear growth rate is presented and its dependence on the governing parameters is briefly discussed. Instabilities referred to as RM-like, driven by localized non-uniform vorticity, also exist; they are either initially deposited or supplied by external sources. Ablative RMI and its stabilization mechanisms are discussed as an example. When the ripple amplitude increases and becomes comparable to the perturbation wavelength, the instability enters the nonlinear phase and the perturbation velocity starts to decrease. An analytical model to describe this second stage of instability evolution is presented within the limit of incompressible and irrotational fluids, based on the dynamics of the contact surface circulation. RMI in solids and liquids is also presented via molecular dynamics simulations for planar and cylindrical geometries, where we show the generation of vorticity even in viscid materials.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.Faraday first characterised the behaviour of a fluid in a container subjected to vertical periodic oscillations. His study pertaining to hydrodynamic instability, the 'Faraday instability', has catalysed a myriad of experimental, theoretical, and numerical studies shedding light on the mechanisms responsible for the transition of a system at rest to a new state of well-ordered vibrational patterns at fixed frequencies. Here we study dual strata in a shallow vessel containing distilled water and high-viscosity lubrication oil on top of it. At elevated driving power, beyond the Faraday instability, the top stratum is found to 'freeze' into a rigid pattern with maxima and minima. At the same time there is a dynamic crossover into a new state in the form of a lattice of recirculating vortices in the lower layer containing the water. Instrumentation and the physics behind are analysed in a phenomenological way together with a basic heuristic modelling of the wave field. The study, which is based on relatively low-budget equipment, stems from related art projects that have evolved over the years. The study is of value within basic research as well as in education, especially as more advanced collective project work in e.g. engineering physics, where it invites further studies of pattern formation, the emergence of vortex lattices and complexity.},

abstract = {We perform linear stability analysis of an interface separating two immiscible, inviscid, quiescent fluids subject to a time-periodic body force. In a generalised, orthogonal coordinate system, the time-dependent amplitude of interfacial perturbations, in the form of standing waves, is shown to be governed by a generalised Mathieu equation. For zero forcing, the Mathieu equation reduces to a (generalised) simple harmonic oscillator equation. The generalised Mathieu equation is shown to govern Faraday waves on four time-periodic base states. We use this equation to demonstrate that Faraday waves and instabilities can arise on an axially unbounded, cylindrical capillary fluid filament subject to radial, time-periodic body force. The stability chart for solutions to the Mathieu equation is obtained through numerical Floquet analysis. For small values of perturbation and forcing amplitude, results obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the incompressible Euler equation (with surface tension) show very good agreement with theoretical predictions. Linear theory predicts that unstable Rayleigh–Plateau modes can be stabilised through forcing. This prediction is borne out by DNS results at early times. Nonlinearity produces higher wavenumbers, some of which can be linearly unstable due to forcing and thus eventually destabilise the filament. We study axisymmetric as well as three-dimensional perturbations through DNS. For large forcing amplitude, localised sheet-like structures emanate from the filament, suffering subsequent fragmentation and breakup. Systematic parametric studies are conducted in a non-dimensional space of five parameters and comparison with linear theory is provided in each case. Our generalised analysis provides a framework for understanding free and (parametrically) forced capillary oscillations on quiescent base states of varying geometrical configurations.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {A low-cost, automated apparatus has been used to perform micrometric deposition of small pendant drops onto a quiet liquid surface. The approach of the drop to the surface is obtained by means of discrete, micron-scale translations in order to achieve deposition at adiabatically zero velocity. This process is not only widely used in scientific investigations in fluid mechanics and thermal sciences but also in engineering and biomedical applications. The apparatus has been designed to produce accurate deposition onto the surface and minimize the vibrations induced in the drop by the movement of the capillary tip. Calibration tests of the apparatus have shown that a descent of the drop by discrete translational steps of ∼ 5.6 $\mu$m and duration of 150–200 ms is sufficient to minimize its penetration depth into the liquid when it touches the surface layer and reduce to a level of noise the vibrations transmitted to it by the translation of the dispenser. Different settings of the experimental setup can be easily implemented for use in a variety of other applications, including deposition onto solid surfaces, surface tension measurements of pendant drops, and wire bonding in microelectronics.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. We present the experimental observations of the Faraday instability when the vibrated liquid is contained in a network of small square cells for exciting frequencies in the range 10 ≤ F≤ 24 Hz. A sweep of the parameter space has been performed to investigate the amplitudes and frequencies of the driving force for which different patterns form over the network. Regular patterns in the form of square lattices are observed for driving frequencies in the range 10 ≤ F {\textless} 14 Hz, while ordered matrices of oscillons are formed for 14 {\textless} F≤ 23 Hz. At F {\textgreater} 23 Hz, disordered periodic patterns appear within individual cells for a small range of amplitudes. In this case, the wave field is dominated by oscillating blobs that interact on the capillary–gravity scale. A Pearson correlation analysis of the recorded videos shows that for all ordered patterns, the surface waves are periodic and correspond to Faraday waves of dominant frequency equal to half the excitation frequency (i.e., f= F/ 2). In contrast, the oscillons formed for 14 {\textless} F≤ 23 Hz are at the first subharmonic (f= F/ 2) and first harmonic (f= F) response frequencies, with higher harmonics being negligible or absent as in most cases. The disordered wave fields forming at F {\textgreater} 23 Hz are not subharmonic and correspond to periodic harmonic waves with f= nF/ 2 (for n= 2 , 4 , {\ldots}). We find that the experimentally determined minimum forcing necessary to destabilize the rest state and generate surface waves is consistent with a recent stability analysis of stationary solutions as derived from a new dispersion relation for time-periodic waves with nonzero forcing and dissipation.},

@article{Perinet2016,
abstract = {(Received ?; revised ?; accepted ?. -To be entered by editorial office) Waves patterns in the Faraday instability have been studied for decades. Besides the rich dynamics that can be observed on the waves at the interface, Faraday waves hide beneath them an elusive range of flow patterns —or streaming patterns— which have not been studied in detail until now. The streaming patterns are responsible for a net circulation in the flow which are reminiscent of convection cells. In this article, we analyse these streaming flows by conducting experiments in a Faraday-wave setup. To visualize the flows, tracers are used to generate both trajectory maps and to probe the streaming velocity field via Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV). We identify three types of patterns and experimentally show that identical Faraday waves can mask streaming patterns that are qualitatively very different. Next we propose a three-dimensional model that explains streaming flows in quasi-inviscid fluids. We show that the streaming inside the fluid arises from a complex coupling between the bulk and the boundary layers. This coupling can be taken into account by applying modified boundary conditions in a three-dimensional Navier-Stokes formulation for the streaming in the bulk. Numerical simulations based on this theoretical framework show good qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimental results. They also highlight the relevance of three-dimensional effects in the streaming patterns. Our simulations reveal that the variety of experimental patterns is deeply linked to the boundary condition at the top interface, which may be strongly affected by the presence of contaminants along the surface.},

Such a system can be implemented by a bouncing drop generating surface waves sustained by a parametric forcing. The motion of the resulting "walker" when confined in a harmonic potential well is generally disordered. Here we show that these trajectories correspond to chaotic regimes characterized by intermittent transitions between a discrete set of states. At any given time, the system is in one of these states characterized by a double quantization of size and angular momentum. A low dimensional intermittency determines their respective probabilities. They thus form an eigenstate basis of decomposition for what would be observed as a superposition of states if all measurements were intrusive.},

Yet some dual characteristics were observed in a system where a macroscopic droplet is guided by a pilot wave it generates. Here we investigate the behaviour of these entities when confined in a two-dimensional harmonic potential well. A discrete set of stable orbits is observed, in the shape of successive generalized Cassinian-like curves (circles, ovals, lemniscates, trefoils and so on). Along these specific trajectories, the droplet motion is characterized by a double quantization of the orbit spatial extent and of the angular momentum. We show that these trajectories are intertwined with the dynamical build-up of central wave-field modes. These dual self-organized modes form a basis of eigenstates on which more complex motions are naturally decomposed.},

abstract = {Foreword to the Web version of the book. In preparing this updated version of the textbook originally published in 1993 and under the title of Subsurface Ventilation and Environmental Engineering, the opportunity has been taken to update material that has seen significant change since the first version was written. The word 'Environmental' has been removed from the title as this term has increasingly come to refer to the surface environment. Several of the major changes are particularly applicable to developments in software that have taken place for planning the ventilation and condition of the underground environment. The book remains a reference and text for professional engineers, researchers and teachers as well as for undergraduate and graduate students who have an interest in the planning and control of the environment in underground mines or other subsurface openings. Accordingly, the theoretical underpinnings of the subject are dealt with in some detail. While the practical techniques of topics such as ventilation surveys or the use of computer software are included, this text is not intended specifically to be a ventilation officer's handbook. Such handbooks are best prepared within individual countries or institutions to reflect local methodologies, conditions and legislation. In addition to printed copies, this updated text is available at no cost for downloading from the Internet address of Mine Ventilation Services, Inc. at:},

Quasi-standing Faraday waves on water create horizontal vortices, yet it is not known whether propagating waves can generate large-scale flows-small-amplitude irrotational waves only push particles in the direction of propagation. Here we show that when waves become three-dimensional as a result of the modulation instability, a floater can be forced to move towards the wave source. The mechanism for this is the generation of surface vortices by waves propagating away from vertically oscillating plungers. We introduce a new conceptual framework for understanding wave-driven flows, which enables us to engineer inward and outward surface jets, stationary vortices, and other complex flows. The results form a new basis for the remote manipulation of objects on fluid surfaces and for a better understanding of the motion of floaters in the ocean, the generation of wave-driven jets, and the formation of Lagrangian coherent structures.},

abstract = {We present results on parametrically forced capillary waves in a circular cylinder, obtained in the limit of large fluid depth, using two low-viscosity liquids whose surface tensions differ by an order of magnitude. The evolution of the wave patterns from the instability to the wave-breaking threshold is investigated in a forcing frequency range (f = omega/2 pi = 25-100 Hz) that is around the crossover frequency (omega(ot)) from gravity to capillary waves (omega(ot)/2 {\textless}=omega/2 {\textless}= 4 omega(ot)). As expected, near the instability threshold the wave pattern depends on the container geometry, but as the forcing amplitude is increased the wave pattern becomes random, and the wall effects are insignificant. Near breaking, the distribution of random wavelengths can be fitted by a Gaussian. A new gravity-capillary scaling is introduced that is more appropriate, than the usual viscous scaling, for low-viscosity fluids and forcing frequencies {\textless}10(3) Hz. In terms of these scales, a criterion is derived to predict the crossover from capillary- to gravity-dominated breaking. A wave-breaking model is developed that gives the relation between the container and the wave accelerations in agreement with experiments. The measured drop size distribution of the ejected drops above the breaking threshold is well approximated by a gamma distribution. The mean drop diameter is proportional to the wavelength determined from the dispersion relation; this wavelength is also close to the most likely wavelength of the random waves at drop ejection. The dimensionless drop ejection rate is shown to have a cubic power law dependence on the dimensionless excess acceleration is an element of'(d) an inertial-gravitational ligament formation model is consistent with such a power law.},

The present results have been obtained in circular cylindrical containers of 10 and 15 cm in diameter (Bond number of order    {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}{\$}   ) in the large fluid depth limit. First, the phase diagrams of instability threshold and wave breaking conditions are determined for the working fluid used, here water with 1 {\%} detergent added. The collapse of the wave-depression cavity is found to be self-similar. The exponent    {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6FC{\}}{\$}   of the variation of the cavity radius    {\$}r{\_}{\{}m{\}}{\$}   with time    {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D70F{\}}{\$}   , in the form    {\$}r{\_}{\{}m{\}}/R\backslashpropto \backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D70F{\}}{\^{}}{\{}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6FC{\}}{\}}{\$}   , is close to 0.5, indicative of inertial collapse, followed by a viscous cut-off of    {\$}\backslashunicode[STIX]{\{}x1D6FC{\}}\backslashapprox 1{\$}   . This supports a Froude number scaling of the surface jet velocity caused by cavity collapse. The dimensionless jet velocity scales with the cavity depth that is shown to be proportional to the last stable wave amplitude. It can be expressed by a power law or in terms of finite time singularity related to a singular wave amplitude that sets the transition from a non-pinching to pinch-off cavity collapse scenario. In terms of forcing amplitude, cavity collapse and jetting are found to occur in bands of events of non-pinching and pinching of a bubble at the cavity base. At large forcing amplitudes, incomplete cavity collapse and splashing can occur and, at even larger forcing amplitudes, wave growth is again stable up to the singular wave amplitude. When the cavity is formed, an impulse model shows the importance of the singular cavity diameter that determines the strength of the impulse. },

abstract = {We consider the response to periodic forcing between 5 Hz and 50 Hz of an interface separating immiscible fluids under the microgravity conditions of a parabolic flight. Two pairs of liquids with viscosity ratios differing by one order of magnitude are investigated. By combining experimental data with numerical simulations, we describe a variety of dynamics including harmonic and subharmonic (Faraday) waves, frozen waves and drop ejection, determining their thresholds and scaling properties when possible. Interaction between these various modes is facilitated in microgravity by the relative ease with which the interface can move, altering its orientation with respect to the forcing axis. The effects of key factors controlling pattern selection are analysed, including vibrational forcing, viscosity ratio, finite-size effects and residual gravity. Complex behaviour often arises with features on several spatial scales, such as Faraday waves excited on the interface of a larger columnar structure that develops due to the frozen wave instability – this type of state was previously seen in miscible fluid experiments but is described for the first time here in the immiscible case.},

@article{Sanfeld2008,
abstract = {The present paper starts with a review of fundamental descriptions based on physico-chemical laws derived for emulsions with a special interest for eventual evidences of drops deformation. A critical analysis of theories and experiments is given that leads the authors to propose new static and dynamic models for the approach to flocculation and coalescence of two deformable drops in dense and dilute environments of other neighboring drops. The model developed is based on an old paper by Albers and Overbeek for W/O dense emulsions with non-deformable particles, that has been improved recently first by Sengupta and Papadopoulos and then by Mishchuk et al. to account for all the interaction forces (electrostatic, van der Waals and steric). The basic idea here rests in the assumption that the flat surface area of the two coalescing drops, interacting in the field of other particles, increases when the distance between the particles decreases according to an exponential law with a characteristic length related to the disjoining force in the inter-particle film and to the capillary pressure that opposes flattening. The difficulty lies, indeed, in manifold interpretations on experimental observations so that no clear conclusion can be derived on mechanisms responsible for the deformation of droplets. This is why, from a pure theoretical and physical point of view, according to rather complicated models, we propose a much more simple approach that permits to define a capillary length as part of virtual operations. In a static approach, this length is based on analogy with electricity, namely repulsion leads to flatness while attraction to hump. Therefore this brings us to a definition of a length depending on the maximum value of the disjoining pressure in competition with the capillary pressure. Gravity also promotes flocculation, therefore we compare the maximum values of the surface forces acting between the surfaces of two floculating particles to gravity. Finally, considering that in most publications on emulsions foams and colloidal systems, much attention is paid on the role of the drainage in the stability process, we devote the last section to the drainage between flattened drops. We first describe briefly Taylor's approach and extend Reynolds revisited formulae taking into account the viscous friction, the disjoining pressure, the film elasticity and the wetting angle weighting the capillary pressure through the characteristic length. Our calculated values are compared to some experimental data. In conclusion to make this long paper as useful as possible for research purposes, we have the hope that our understanding of emulsion stability is not only based on knowledge of numerous theoretical and experimental works sometimes controversial given in a critical way but that it gives a new approach based on an interpretation of the drop deformation in terms of a characteristic length linked to a deformation number analogous to a Bond number. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this Thesis, a monolayer of macroscopic particles floating on a surface wave is studied. The liquid is pure water so that the particles are at a water-air interface. The particles are hydrophilic polystyrene spheres with average radius around 0.31 mm and they are slightly heavier than water. The surface wave is a Faraday wave, which is a wave generated at a liquid-air interface when a layer of liquid is exposed to a vertical periodic driving. We demonstrate the role of the particle concentration on the spatial distribution of our hydrophilic heavy spheres floating on a water standing Faraday wave. At low concentration, we observe that our floaters form clusters at the antinodes of the standing wave. On the other hand, at high concentration with the same floaters, inverted patterns, i.e., clustering patterns at the nodal lines of the wave, form. The wave drift and the attractive capillary interaction are the mechanisms driving the clusters. By suggesting an energy calculation, we confirm both the experimentally observed clusters and the transition point from antinode clusters to node clusters. Heterogeneous dynamics of the floaters on nonlinear chaotic waves, namely capillary Faraday wave with a wavelength order of floater size, is the other subject studied experimentally in this Thesis. We observe that the resultant flow is composed of the floater domains, i.e., small floater groups initially moving together, breaking up in a certain way some time later. During the break-up process, the initial floater group morphologically deforms. We develop a morphological approach to quantify the deformation of the domains in time. We show that our suggested morphological characterization of the floater groups is a valuable alternative representation of the dynamical heterogeneities generated by such a particulate flow, which up to now have mainly been quantified by the four-point dynamic susceptibility in the literature.},

abstract = {Parametrically excited surface wave modes on a fluid layer driven by vertical forcing can interact with each other when more than one spatial mode is excited. We have investigated the dynamics of the interaction of two modes that are degenerate in a square layer, but non-degenerate in a rectangular one. Novel experimental techniques were developed for this purpose, including the real-time measurement of all relevant slowly varying mode amplitudes, investigation of the phase-space structure by means of transient studies starting from a variety of initial conditions, and automated determination of stability boundaries as a function of driving amplitude and frequency. These methods allowed both stable and unstable fixed points (sinks, sources, and saddles) to be determined, and the nature of the bifurcation sequences to be clearly established. In most of the dynamical regimes, multiple attractors and repellers (up to 16) were found, including both pure and mixed modes. We found that the symmetry of the fluid cell has dramatic effects on the dynamics. The fully degenerate case (square cell) yields no time-dependent patterns, and is qualitatively understood in terms of third-order amplitude equations whose basic structure follows from symmetry arguments. In a slightly rectangular cell, where the two modes are separated in frequency by a small amount (about 1$\backslash${\%}), mode competition produces both periodic and chaotic states organized around unstable pure and mixed-state fixed points.},

abstract = {The Faraday problem is an important pattern-forming system that provides some middle ground between systems where the initial instability involves just a single mode, and in which complexity then results from mode interactions or secondary bifurcations, and cases where a system is highly turbulent and many spatial and temporal modes are excited. It has been a rich source of novel patterns and of theoretical work aimed at understanding how and why such patterns occur. Yet it is particularly challenging to tie theory to experiment: the experiments are difficult to perform; the parameter regime of interest (large box, moderate viscosity) along with the technical difficulties of solving the free-boundary Navier–Stokes equations make numerical solution of the problem hard; and the fact that the instabilities result in an entire circle of unstable wavevectors presents considerable theoretical difficulties. In principle, weakly nonlinear theory should be able to predict which patterns are stable near pattern onset. In this paper we present the first quantitative comparison between weakly nonlinear theory of the full Navier–Stokes equations and (previously published) experimental results for the Faraday problem with multiple-frequency forcing. We confirm that three-wave interactions sit at the heart of why complex patterns are stabilised, but also highlight some discrepancies between theory and experiment. These suggest the need for further experimental and theoretical work to fully investigate the issues of pattern bistability and the role of bicritical/tricritical points in determining bifurcation structure.},

At a depth of 4mm and for various silicon liquids having kinematic viscosities of 10, 20, and 38 cSt, we determined the acceleration at which patterns form for frequencies between 10 and 60 Hz. For the 10 and 20 cSt cases, it was found that the acceleration at which these patterns form does not heavily depend upon the viscosity of their host liquid. This is in stark contrast with the current body of knowledge. The case for 38 cSt, however, varies from the other two cases in both value and shape.},

abstract = {One feature that distinguishes pressureless, ultrasonic atomizing nozzles from most other spray nozzles is a soft, low-velocity spray, typically on the order of 3-5 inches per second. Other common atomization techniques, which use pressure in order to generate a spray, generally produce drops with velocities well over 100 times that generated by ultrasonic atomization. This velocity differential means that pressure sprays generate on the order of 10,000 as much kinetic energy as do ultrasonically atomized sprays. This striking contrast in spray energy has important, practical implications. In coating applications, the unpresssurized, low-velocity spray significantly reduces the amount of overspray since the drops tend to settle on the substrate, rather than bounce off it. This translates into substantial material savings and reduction in emissions into the environment. The spray can be controlled and shaped precisely by entraining the slow-moving spray in an ancillary air stream. Spray patterns from as small as 0.070 inches wide to as much as 1-2 feet wide can be generated using specialized types of spray-shaping equipment.},

abstract = {The instability of a vertically oscillated layer of fluid is a classical problem whose history dates back to Faraday in the 19th century. We consider the stability of a shallow layer for which the oscillation, as expressed through the effective gravitational acceleration, is a random function of time. Using both theoretical linear stability analysis and high-resolution numerical simulations, including both individual realizations and ensemble calculations, of the nonlinear system of equations, we find that two different stochastic modes of instability exist. Both modes find their expression in finite amplitude oscillations of the free surface that exhibit sharp crests and broad troughs, or in other words, that resemble the classical Stokes wave. We demonstrate that a necessary condition for the first type of instability is snapshot, or instantaneous, instability. The subdominant instability resembles classical parametric resonance that can exist in a harmonically oscillated layer of fluid, and occurs even when the flow is always snapshot stable (or the gravitational acceleration is non-negative).},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd. We study Faraday and resonant waves in two-component quasi-one-dimensional (cigar-shaped) collisionally inhomogeneous Bose-Einstein condensates subject to periodic modulation of the radial confinement. We show by means of extensive numerical simulations that, as the system exhibits stronger spatially-localised binary collisions (whose scattering length is taken for convenience to be of Gaussian form), the system becomes effectively a linear one. In other words, as the scattering length approaches a delta-function, we observe that the two nonlinear configurations typical for binary cigar-shaped condensates, namely the segregated and the symbiotic one, turn into two overlapping Gaussian wave functions typical for linear systems, and that the instability onset times of the Faraday and resonant waves become longer. Moreover, our numerical simulations show that the spatial period of the excited waves (either resonant or Faraday ones) decreases as the inhomogeneity becomes stronger. Our results also demonstrate that the topology of the ground state impacts the dynamics of the ensuing density waves, and that the instability onset times of Faraday and resonant waves, for a given level of inhomogeneity in the two-body interactions, depend on whether the initial configuration is segregated or symbiotic.},

There are several well-studied classical modulation instabilities, such as Benjamin-Feir, Turing and Faraday instability, which play a critical role in the self-organization of energy and matter in non-equilibrium physical, chemical and biological systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate the dissipative Faraday instability induced by spatially periodic zig-zag modulation of a dissipative parameter of the system-spectrally dependent losses-achieving generation of temporal patterns and high-harmonic mode-locking in a fibre laser. We demonstrate features of this instability that distinguish it from both the Benjamin-Feir and the purely dispersive Faraday instability. Our results open the possibilities for new designs of mode-locked lasers and can be extended to other fields of physics and engineering.},

abstract = {We investigate the role weakly damped modes play in the selection of Faraday wave patterns forced with rationally related frequency components m?? and n??. We use symmetry considerations to argue for the special importance of the weakly damped modes oscillating with twice the frequency of the critical mode, and those oscillating primarily with the "difference frequency" |n - m|?? and the "sum frequency" (n + m)??. We then perform a weakly nonlinear analysis using equations of Zhang and Vi??als [J. Fluid Mech. 336 (1997) 301] which apply to small-amplitude waves on weakly inviscid, deep fluid layers. For weak damping and forcing and one-dimensional waves, we perform a perturbation expansion through fourth-order which yields analytical expressions for onset parameters and the cubic bifurcation coefficient that determines wave amplitude as a function of forcing. For stronger damping and forcing we numerically compute these same parameters, as well as the cubic cross-coupling coefficient for competing standing waves oriented at an angle ?? relative to each other. The resonance effects predicted by symmetry are borne out in the perturbation results for one spatial dimension, and agree with the numerical results for two dimensions. The difference frequency resonance plays a key role in stabilizing superlattice patterns of the SL-I type observed by Kudrolli et al. [Physica D 123 (1-4) (1998) 99]. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Faraday waves are standing waves which arise through a parametric instability on the surface of a vertically oscillated fluid layer. They can emerge with various symmetries, simply square to N-fold rotationally symmetric, which for N {\textgreater} 3 are quasi-crystalline. In an experiment with a very large aspect ratio we determine the boundaries of the stability regions of waves with different rotational symmetries in the driving frequency-amplitude parameter plane. We find a remarkable agreement with a recent theory by Chen {\&} Vinals (1999) who predict the stability boundaries at the onset amplitude. We argue why such agreement can only be observed in a very large experiment. The main nonlinear damping mechanism of the waves is a three-wave resonance. We devise a simple model that captures this mechanism and that can explain quantitatively the change of the symmetry of the waves with fluid depth. Detailed information about the surface is obtained by scanning the wave field and measuring the phase of subharmonic and harmonic components. Also the results of these measurements compare very favourably to the theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {A numerical method is developed to study the stability of standing water waves and other time-periodic solutions of the free-surface Euler equations using Floquet theory. A Fourier truncation of the monodromy operator is computed by solving the linearized Euler equations about the standing wave with initial conditions ranging over all Fourier modes up to a given wave number. The eigenvalues of the truncated monodromy operator are computed and ordered by the mean wave number of the corresponding eigenfunctions, which we introduce as a method of retaining only accurately computed Floquet multipliers. The mean wave number matches up with analytical results for the zero-amplitude standing wave and is helpful in identifying which Floquet multipliers collide and leave the unit circle to form unstable eigenmodes or rejoin the unit circle to regain stability. For standing waves in deep water, most waves with crest acceleration below {\$}A{\_}c=0.889{\$} are found to be linearly stable to harmonic perturbations; however, we find several bubbles of instability at lower values of {\$}A{\_}c{\$} that have not been reported previously in the literature. We also study the stability of several new or recently discovered time-periodic gravity-capillary or gravity waves in deep or shallow water, finding several examples of large-amplitude waves that are stable to harmonic perturbations and others that are not. A new method of matching the Floquet multipliers of two nearby standing waves by solving a linear assignment problem is also proposed to track individual eigenvalues via homotopy from the zero-amplitude state to large-amplitude standing waves.},

abstract = {This dissertation focuses on the fluid dynamics of dilute polymer solutions. At low Reynolds number, viscoelastic stagnation-point flow is studied, where various instabilities have been reported experimentally. We computationally demonstrate the existence of a supercritical oscillatory instability of low-Reynolds number viscoelastic flow in a two-dimensional cross-slot geometry. A mechanism of this instability is presented, which arises from the coupling of flow with extensional stresses and their steep gradients in the stagnation point region. In turbulent flows, polymer additives are known to reduce turbulent friction drag significantly at very low concentrations. By applying the minimal flow unit (MFU) method to viscoelastic turbulent flows at a Reynolds number close to the laminar-turbulence transition, the essential self-sustaining turbulent motions are isolated. These MFU solutions contain a series of qualitatively different stages, including one asymptotic limit showing the characteristic of maximum drag reduction (MDR): i.e. the mean flow is universal with respect to changing polymer-related parameters. Before this asymptotic limit, distinctions between a low- (LDR) and high-degree (HDR) of drag reduction are noticed, including an abrupt increase in the minimal box size of sustaining turbulence as well as transitions in many flow statistics quantities. Spatiotemporal flow structures, as well as the fact this transition is observed at less than 15{\%} drag reduction, show that LDR--HDR transition is caused by a qualitative change in the dynamics of the self-sustaining process. These solutions recover all key transitions commonly observed and studied at much higher Reynolds numbers. In all stages of transition, even in the Newtonian limit, we find intervals of "hibernating" turbulence that display many features of the experimental MDR: weak streamwise vortices, nearly nonexistent streamwise variations and a mean velocity gradient that quantitatively matches experiments. As viscoelasticity increases, the frequency of these intervals also increases, while the intervals themselves are unchanged, leading to flows that increasingly resemble MDR. This observation points out a new direction of understanding the unsolved mechanism of MDR.},

abstract = { We report an abrupt change in the diffusive transport of inertial objects in wave-driven turbulence as a function of the object size. In these non-equilibrium two-dimensional flows, the turbulent diffusion coefficient    {\$}D{\$}   of finite-size objects undergoes a sharp change for values of the object size    {\$}r{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\$}   close to the flow forcing scale    {\$}L{\_}{\{}f{\}}{\$}   . For objects larger than the forcing scale (    {\$}r{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\textgreater}L{\_}{\{}f{\}}{\$}   ), the diffusion coefficient is proportional to the flow energy    {\$}U{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}   and inversely proportional to the size    {\$}r{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\$}   . This behaviour,    {\$}D\backslashsim U{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}/r{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\$}   , observed in a chaotic macroscopic system is reminiscent of a fluctuation–dissipation relation. In contrast, the diffusion coefficient of smaller objects (    {\$}r{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\textless}L{\_}{\{}f{\}}{\$}   ) follows    {\$}D\backslashsim U/r{\_}{\{}p{\}}{\^{}}{\{}0.35{\}}{\$}   . This result does not allow simple analogies to be drawn but instead it reflects strong coupling of the small objects with the fabric and memory of the out-of-equilibrium flow. In these turbulent flows, the flow structure is dominated by transient but long-living bundles of fluid particle trajectories executing random walk. The characteristic widths of the bundles are close to    {\$}L{\_}{\{}f{\}}{\$}   . We propose a simple phenomenology in which large objects interact with many bundles. This interaction with many degrees of freedom is the source of the fluctuation–dissipation-like relation. In contrast, smaller objects are advected within coherent bundles, resulting in diffusion properties closely related to those of fluid tracers. },

abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that by generating two orthogonal standing waves at the liquid surface, one can control the motion of floating microparticles. The mechanism of the vortex generation is somewhat similar to a classical Stokes drift in linear progression waves. By adjusting the relative phase between the waves, it is possible to generate a vortex lattice, seen as a stationary horizontal flow consisting of counter-rotating vortices. Two orthogonal waves which are phase-shifted by $\pi$ / 2 create locally rotating waves. Such waves induce nested circular drift orbits of the surface fluid particles. Such a configuration allows for the trapping of particles within a cell of the size about half the wavelength of the standing waves. By changing the relative phase, it is possible to either create or to destroy the vortex crystal. This method creates an opportunity to confine surface particles within cells, or to greatly increase mixing of the surface matter over the wave field surface.},

A three-dimensional, algebraic slip mixture (ASM) model is used as part of the CFD software FLUENT 6.3 to obtain the numerical solutions. The results for the pressure drop are compared with experimental data of slurry prepared with de-asphalted oil as the liquid phase and asphaltic residues as the solid phase with mean particle sizes of 500 µm. Based on the experimental measurements, the critical deposition velocity for these slurries was estimated to vary from 0.171 m s−1(for 1{\%} solid concentration and mean slurry velocity of 0.22 m s−1) to 0.66 m s−1(for 12{\%} concentration and mean slurry velocity of 2.3 m s−1). However, for the full range of mean velocities tested, the flow of these highly viscous mixtures was found to be in a homogeneous regime. The numerically predicted pressure drops are in good agreement with the experimental data with relative deviations of ∼0.8–13{\%}. In contrast, errors of ∼3–24{\%} are obtained when comparing the experimental results with the Fanning friction factor correlation. While the temperature of the circulating slurry rises with the flow rate due to viscous heating and friction of the solid particles with the pipe walls, we find that at the moderate flow velocities and efflux concentrations considered the slurry morphology is not affected by the gradual dissolution of the solid particles (asphaltenes) into the liquid phase. Other important slurry flow characteristics, such as the mean slurry friction coefficient and slurry velocity distribution, are also analyzed, which predict the homogeneous, symmetric character of the flow.},

abstract = {Pattern formation in parametric surface waves is studied in the limit of weak viscous dissipation. A set of quasi-potential equations (QPEs) is introduced that admits a closed representation in terms of surface variables alone. A multiscale expansion of the QPEs reveals the importance of triad resonant interactions, and the saturating effect of the driving force leading to a gradient amplitude equation. Minimization of the associated Lyapunov function yields standing wave patterns of square symmetry for capillary waves, and hexagonal patterns and a sequence of quasi-patterns for mixed capillary-gravity waves. Numerical integration of the QPEs reveals a quasi-pattern of eight-fold symmetry in the range of parameters predicted by the multiscale expansion.},

@article{Zhang1997,
abstract = {We present a theoretical study of nonlinear pattern formation in parametric$\backslash$nsurface waves for fluids of low viscosity, and in the limit of large$\backslash$naspect ratio. The analysis is based on a quasi-potential approximation$\backslash$nto the equations governing fluid motion, followed by a multiscale$\backslash$nasymptotic expansion in the distance away from threshold. Close to$\backslash$nonset, the asymptotic expansion yields an amplitude equation which$\backslash$nis of gradient form, and allows the explicit calculation of the functional$\backslash$nform of the cubic nonlinearities. In particular, we find that three-wave$\backslash$nresonant interactions contribute significantly to the nonlinear terms,$\backslash$nand therefore are important for pattern selection. Minimization of$\backslash$nthe associated Lyapunov functional predicts a primary bifurcation$\backslash$nto a standing wave pattern of square symmetry for capillary-dominated$\backslash$nsurface waves, in agreement with experiments. In addition, we find$\backslash$nthat patterns of hexagonal and quasi-crystalline symmetry can be$\backslash$nstabilized in certain mixed capillary-gravity waves, even in this$\backslash$ncase of single-frequency forcing. Quasi-crystalline patterns are$\backslash$npredicted in a region of parameters readily accessible experimentally.},

@article{Zoueshtiagh2009,
abstract = {A study of the Faraday instability of diffuse interfaces between pairs of miscible liquids of different densities, by means of experiments and by a nonlinear numerical model, is presented. The experimental set-up consisted of a rectangular cell in which the lighter liquid was placed above the denser one. The cell in this initially stable configuration was then subjected to vertical vibrations. The subsequent behaviour of the ‘interface' between the two liquids was observed with a high-speed camera. This study shows that above a certain acceleration threshold an instability developed at the interface. The amplitude of the instability grew during the experiments which then led to the mixing of the liquids. The instability finally disappeared once the two liquids were fully mixed over a volume, considerably larger than the initial diffuse region. The results of a companion two-dimensional nonlinear numerical model that employs a finite volume method show very good agreement with the experiments. A physical explanation of the instability and the observations are advanced.},
