	Abstract = {This thesis is an overview of our investigation of Faraday waves and jets on free surfaces. Faraday waves are standing waves generated by a parametric oscilla- tion. We will consider the parametric oscillation of gravity in this study. A cylinder containing the fluid of interest is mounted on a vibration device which shakes the entire setup vertically. In this way the effective gravity is modified which generates period-doubled standing waves in the fluid. Continu- ous excitation leads to very large amplitudes. The surface of the fluid becomes unstable and collapses symmetrically. This singularity, caused by inertial focus- ing, leads to jet formation. High speed imaging techniques are used to capture the surface profiles of the standing waves, cavities and jets. The maximum tip velocity found in our setup was 22ms−1. The dynamics of the bulk flow, the boundary layers and the contact line are treated separately. Their contributions are combined in a single model by con- sidering the mechanical energy.},

@book{Sanl2012,
	Abstract = {In this Thesis, a monolayer of macroscopic particles floating on a surface wave is studied. The liquid is pure water so that the particles are at a water-air interface. The particles are hydrophilic polystyrene spheres with average radius around 0.31 mm and they are slightly heavier than water. The surface wave is a Faraday wave, which is a wave generated at a liquid-air interface when a layer of liquid is exposed to a vertical periodic driving. We demonstrate the role of the particle concentration on the spatial distribution of our hydrophilic heavy spheres floating on a water standing Faraday wave. At low concentration, we observe that our floaters form clusters at the antinodes of the standing wave. On the other hand, at high concentration with the same floaters, inverted patterns, i.e., clustering patterns at the nodal lines of the wave, form. The wave drift and the attractive capillary interaction are the mechanisms driving the clusters. By suggesting an energy calculation, we confirm both the experimentally observed clusters and the transition point from antinode clusters to node clusters. Heterogeneous dynamics of the floaters on nonlinear chaotic waves, namely capillary Faraday wave with a wavelength order of floater size, is the other subject studied experimentally in this Thesis. We observe that the resultant flow is composed of the floater domains, i.e., small floater groups initially moving together, breaking up in a certain way some time later. During the break-up process, the initial floater group morphologically deforms. We develop a morphological approach to quantify the deformation of the domains in time. We show that our suggested morphological characterization of the floater groups is a valuable alternative representation of the dynamical heterogeneities generated by such a particulate flow, which up to now have mainly been quantified by the four-point dynamic susceptibility in the literature.},

@article{Simonelli1989,
	Abstract = {Parametrically excited surface wave modes on a fluid layer driven by vertical forcing can interact with each other when more than one spatial mode is excited. We have investigated the dynamics of the interaction of two modes that are degenerate in a square layer, but non-degenerate in a rectangular one. Novel experimental techniques were developed for this purpose, including the real-time measurement of all relevant slowly varying mode amplitudes, investigation of the phase-space structure by means of transient studies starting from a variety of initial conditions, and automated determination of stability boundaries as a function of driving amplitude and frequency. These methods allowed both stable and unstable fixed points (sinks, sources, and saddles) to be determined, and the nature of the bifurcation sequences to be clearly established. In most of the dynamical regimes, multiple attractors and repellers (up to 16) were found, including both pure and mixed modes. We found that the symmetry of the fluid cell has dramatic effects on the dynamics. The fully degenerate case (square cell) yields no time-dependent patterns, and is qualitatively understood in terms of third-order amplitude equations whose basic structure follows from symmetry arguments. In a slightly rectangular cell, where the two modes are separated in frequency by a small amount (about 1$\backslash${\%}), mode competition produces both periodic and chaotic states organized around unstable pure and mixed-state fixed points.},

@article{Craik1995,
	Abstract = {Experiments are described on surface gravity-capillary waves in a 70 cm × 2.8 cm rectangular tank undergoing small vertical oscillations. The large aspect ratio of the tank permits study of several neighbouring two-dimensional wave modes; their onset, hysteresis and instability. Two water depths, close to one and two centimetres, are investigated in detail. Thresholds are determined for wave onset from a flat surface and the hysteretic return to a flat surface from finite-amplitude waves. Also, conditions at which a pure standing wave becomes unstable to other modes are established. Our finding of hysteresis below the minimum forcing for linear wave-onset suggests that nonlinear forcing and nonlinear damping are both significant, as recently suggested by Miles (J. Fluid Mechanics 248 (1993) 671.) A theoretical model, incorporating these effects, is analysed and the corresponding hysteresis boundaries established. These are broadly consistent with our experimental results. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

	Abstract = {We study the generation of 2D turbulence in Faraday waves by investigating the creation of spatially periodic vortices in this system. Measurements which couple a diffusing light imaging technique and particle tracking algorithms allow the simultaneous observation of the three-dimensional fluid motion and of the temporal changes in the wave field topography. Quasi-standing waves are found to coexist with a spatially extended fluid transport. More specifically, the destruction of regular patterns of oscillons coincides with the emergence of a complex fluid motion whose statistics are similar to that of two-dimensional turbulence. We reveal that a lattice of oscillons generates vorticity at the oscillon scale in the horizontal flow. The interaction of these vortices explain how 2D turbulence is fueled by almost standing waves. Remarkably, the curvature of Lagrangian trajectories reveals a "footprint" of the forcing scale vortices in fully developed turbulence. 2D Navier-Stokes turbulence should be considered a source of disorder in Faraday waves. These findings also provide a new paradigm for vorticity creation in 2D flows.},

	Abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

@article{Kudrolli1998,
	Abstract = {We report novel superlattice wave patterns at the interface of a fluid layer driven vertically. These patterns are described most naturally in terms of two interacting hexagonal sublattices. Two frequency forcing at very large aspect ratio is utilized in this work. A superlattice pattern (``superlattice-I'') consisting of two hexagonal lattices oriented at a relative angle of 22$\,^{\circ}$ is obtained with a 6:7 ratio of forcing frequencies. Several theoretical approaches that may be useful in understanding this pattern have been proposed. In another example, the waves are fully described by two superimposed hexagonal lattices with a wavelength ratio of Image , oriented at a relative angle 30$\,^{\circ}$. The time dependence of this ``suoerlattice-II'' wave pattern is unusual. The instantaneous patterns reveal a time-periodic stripe modulation that breaks the sixfold symmetry at any instant, but the stripes are absent in the time average. The instantaneous patterns are not simply amplitude modulations of the primary standing wave. A transition from the superlattice-II state to a 12-fold quasi-crystalline pattern is observed by changing the relative phase of the two forcing frequencies. Phase diagrams of the observed patterns (including superlattices, quasicrystalline patterns, ordinary hexagons, and squares) are obtained as a function of the amplitudes and relative phases of the driving accelerations.},

At a depth of 4mm and for various silicon liquids having kinematic viscosities of 10, 20, and 38 cSt, we determined the acceleration at which patterns form for frequencies between 10 and 60 Hz. For the 10 and 20 cSt cases, it was found that the acceleration at which these patterns form does not heavily depend upon the viscosity of their host liquid. This is in stark contrast with the current body of knowledge. The case for 38 cSt, however, varies from the other two cases in both value and shape.},

	Abstract = {The electrohydrodynamic pattern forming instability (EHC) driven by an ac voltage applied to a homeotropically aligned nematic liquid crystal layer is experimentally studied near onset. By controlling an external magnetic field, many different scenarios become accessible. For finite fields various regular convective structures are observed, which we call, for example, wavy, chain, and bamboo-chevron patterns. The various types are documented with the help of a phase diagram governed by the frequency and the strength of the applied ac voltage. In addition the stability regimes in the voltage?wavenumber plane (the ?Busse balloon?) are mapped out. One finds significant differences from the conventional planar case, for which a theoretical analysis is lacking so far. For zero magnetic field, on the other hand, no regular structure is observed, even immediately above the onset of EHC. A new spatiotemporally chaotic pattern called the soft mode turbulence directly appears via a supercritical bifurcation from the nonconvective state. This is due to the presence of the Goldstone mode related to the spontaneously broken rotational symmetry associated with the director component in the plane of the layer.

@article{Skeldon2015,
	Abstract = {The Faraday problem is an important pattern-forming system that provides some middle ground between systems where the initial instability involves just a single mode, and in which complexity then results from mode interactions or secondary bifurcations, and cases where a system is highly turbulent and many spatial and temporal modes are excited. It has been a rich source of novel patterns and of theoretical work aimed at understanding how and why such patterns occur. Yet it is particularly challenging to tie theory to experiment: the experiments are difficult to perform; the parameter regime of interest (large box, moderate viscosity) along with the technical difficulties of solving the free-boundary Navier--Stokes equations make numerical solution of the problem hard; and the fact that the instabilities result in an entire circle of unstable wavevectors presents considerable theoretical difficulties. In principle, weakly nonlinear theory should be able to predict which patterns are stable near pattern onset. In this paper we present the first quantitative comparison between weakly nonlinear theory of the full Navier--Stokes equations and (previously published) experimental results for the Faraday problem with multiple-frequency forcing. We confirm that three-wave interactions sit at the heart of why complex patterns are stabilised, but also highlight some discrepancies between theory and experiment. These suggest the need for further experimental and theoretical work to fully investigate the issues of pattern bistability and the role of bicritical/tricritical points in determining bifurcation structure.},

@book{Patterson2014,
	Abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

The spatiotemporal behavior of four qualitatively different types of superlattice patterns is described in detail. These states are generated via a number of different three-wave resonant interactions. They occur either as symmetry-breaking bifurcations of hexagonal patterns composed of a single unstable mode or via nonlinear interactions between the two primary unstable modes generated by the two forcing frequencies. A coherent picture of these states together with the phase space in which they appear is presented. In addition, we describe a number of new superlattice states generated by four-wave interactions that arise when symmetry constraints rule out three-wave resonances.},

	Abstract = {Ligament formation from the surface of a horizontal liquid layer subject to a vertical vibration (Faraday instability) is a crucial part of the atomization process because it is the transition phase for droplet generation. Based on the numerical solutions of the two-dimensional incompressible Euler equations for a prototype Faraday instability flow, we explored physically how a liquid ligament that is dynamically free from the vibrating liquid layer and behaves like a jet can be produced. According to linear theory, the suction of liquid from the trough portion to the crest portion creates an amplified crest. The amplified crest is always pulled back to the liquid layer in linear theory, no matter how largely the surface deforms; thus, a dynamically freed ligament never forms. However, under nonlinear conditions produced by large surface deformation, the impinging liquid flow from the trough portion enhances the pressure at the high crest (ligament) root. This pressure enhancement has two major effects. First, it reduces the amount of liquid sucked from the trough portion, which abates the increase in the crest height compared with that associated with linear theory. Second, it forms a local maximum pressure at the crest root; in this case, the ligament above this location becomes dynamically free from the motion of the bottom substrate in the laboratory reference frame. Liquid elements continuously enter the dynamically freed liquid region, producing a slender ligament from the liquid layer. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The instability of a vertically oscillated layer of fluid is a classical problem whose history dates back to Faraday in the 19th century. We consider the stability of a shallow layer for which the oscillation, as expressed through the effective gravitational acceleration, is a random function of time. Using both theoretical linear stability analysis and high-resolution numerical simulations, including both individual realizations and ensemble calculations, of the nonlinear system of equations, we find that two different stochastic modes of instability exist. Both modes find their expression in finite amplitude oscillations of the free surface that exhibit sharp crests and broad troughs, or in other words, that resemble the classical Stokes wave. We demonstrate that a necessary condition for the first type of instability is snapshot, or instantaneous, instability. The subdominant instability resembles classical parametric resonance that can exist in a harmonically oscillated layer of fluid, and occurs even when the flow is always snapshot stable (or the gravitational acceleration is non-negative).},

It is intended as a textbook for advanced graduate courses and as a reference for research students and professional research workers. The first two Chapters are an introduction to the mathematics, and the experimental results, for the instability of laminar (or inviscid) flows to infinitesimal (in practice ``small'') disturbances. The third Chapter develops this linear theory in more detail and describes its application to particular problems. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with instability to finite-amplitude disturbances: much of the material has previously been available only in research papers.},

@article{Higginbotham2011b,
	Abstract = {A popular method for generating micron-sized aerosols is to submerge ultrasonic ($\omega${\~{}}MHz) piezoelectric oscillators in a water bath. The submerged oscillator atomizes the fluid, creating droplets with radii proportional to the wavelength of the standing wave at the fluid surface. Classical theory for the Faraday instability predicts a parametric instability driving a capillary wave at the subharmonic ($\omega$/2) frequency. For many applications it is desirable to reduce the size of the droplets; however, using higher frequency oscillators becomes impractical beyond a few MHz. Observations are presented that demonstrate that smaller droplets may also be created by increasing the driving amplitude of the oscillator, and that this effect becomes more pronounced for large driving frequencies. It is shown that these observations are consistent with a transition from droplets associated with subharmonic ($\omega$/2) capillary waves to harmonic ($\omega$) capillary waves induced by larger driving frequencies and amplitudes, as predicted by a stability analysis of the capillary waves.},

@article{Lee2008b,
	Abstract = {It is very difficult to fabricate tunable optical systems having an aperture below 1000 micrometers with the conventional means on macroscopic scale. Krogmann et al. (J. Opt. A 8, S330-S336, 2006) presented a MEMS-based tunable liquid micro-lens system with an aperture of 300 micrometers. The system exhibited a tuning range of back focal length between 2.3mm and infinity by using the electrowetting effect to change the contact angle of the meniscus shape on silicon with a voltage of 0-45 V. However, spherical aberration was found in their lens system. In the present study, a numerical simulation is performed for this same physical configuration by solving the Young-Laplace equation on the interface of the lens liquid and the surrounding liquid. The resulting meniscus shape produces a back focal length that agrees with the experimental observation excellently. To eliminate the spherical aberration, an electric field is applied on the lens. The electric field alters the Young-Laplace equation and thus changes the meniscus shape and the lens quality. The numerical result shows that the spherical aberration of the lens can be essentially eliminated when a proper electric field is applied.},

	Abstract = {Foam and emulsion jamming at low shear rates is explained by considering the thinning dynamics of the transient films, formed between neighboring bubbles and drops. After thinning gradually to a critical thickness, these films undergo an instability transition, which leads to the formation of very thin "black films" providing strong adhesion between the dispersed particles. Analysis shows that such film thickness instability occurs only if the contact time between particles is sufficiently long-an explicit expression for the respective critical shear rate is derived and compared to experimental data.},

@article{Sanfeld2008a,
	Abstract = {The present paper starts with a review of fundamental descriptions based on physico-chemical laws derived for emulsions with a special interest for eventual evidences of drops deformation. A critical analysis of theories and experiments is given that leads the authors to propose new static and dynamic models for the approach to flocculation and coalescence of two deformable drops in dense and dilute environments of other neighboring drops. The model developed is based on an old paper by Albers and Overbeek for W/O dense emulsions with non-deformable particles, that has been improved recently first by Sengupta and Papadopoulos and then by Mishchuk et al. to account for all the interaction forces (electrostatic, van der Waals and steric). The basic idea here rests in the assumption that the flat surface area of the two coalescing drops, interacting in the field of other particles, increases when the distance between the particles decreases according to an exponential law with a characteristic length related to the disjoining force in the inter-particle film and to the capillary pressure that opposes flattening. The difficulty lies, indeed, in manifold interpretations on experimental observations so that no clear conclusion can be derived on mechanisms responsible for the deformation of droplets. This is why, from a pure theoretical and physical point of view, according to rather complicated models, we propose a much more simple approach that permits to define a capillary length as part of virtual operations. In a static approach, this length is based on analogy with electricity, namely repulsion leads to flatness while attraction to hump. Therefore this brings us to a definition of a length depending on the maximum value of the disjoining pressure in competition with the capillary pressure. Gravity also promotes flocculation, therefore we compare the maximum values of the surface forces acting between the surfaces of two floculating particles to gravity. Finally, considering that in most publications on emulsions foams and colloidal systems, much attention is paid on the role of the drainage in the stability process, we devote the last section to the drainage between flattened drops. We first describe briefly Taylor's approach and extend Reynolds revisited formulae taking into account the viscous friction, the disjoining pressure, the film elasticity and the wetting angle weighting the capillary pressure through the characteristic length. Our calculated values are compared to some experimental data. In conclusion to make this long paper as useful as possible for research purposes, we have the hope that our understanding of emulsion stability is not only based on knowledge of numerous theoretical and experimental works sometimes controversial given in a critical way but that it gives a new approach based on an interpretation of the drop deformation in terms of a characteristic length linked to a deformation number analogous to a Bond number.},

@article{Kumar2000b,
	Abstract = {This report presents a discussion of the wave number selection mechanism in the Faraday instability, which arises when standing waves form on the free surface of a liquid subject to vertical sinusoidal oscillation. The focus is on the case where the viscous effects are strong, i.e., when the wavelength is of the same order of magnitude as the boundary layer thickness at the free surface. We investigate the relationship between the Faraday instability and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability by performing linear stability calculations. In the deep water limit (wavelength {\textless} liquid depth), our results indicate that the preferred wave number in the Faraday instability is primarily determined through a Rayleigh-Taylor instability. In the case of shallow water (wavelength approximately liquid depth), the agreement between the Rayleigh-Taylor and Faraday wave numbers does not appear to be as good, probably due to the interaction between the oscillatory motion of the standing waves and the bottom boundary.},
